## âœ… Problem Fixed

**Issue**: GitHub was blocking your push because it detected exposed API keys/secrets in your workflow files:

- **Perplexity API Key** in `workflows by Zie619/1756_Code_HTTP_Automation_Webhook.json`
- **Apify API Token** in `workflows by Zie619/1964_HTTP_Aggregate_Automation_Webhook.json`

## ğŸ”§ Solution Applied

1. **Removed secrets from git history**: Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove the files containing secrets from the entire git history
2. **Recreated files with placeholders**: Recreated both workflow files with placeholder values:
   - `[EXPOSED_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY]` â†’ `YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
   - `[EXPOSED_APIFY_API_TOKEN]` â†’ `YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN`
3. **Successfully pushed**: The repository now pushes without any security violations

## ğŸš€ Result

Your repository is now successfully pushed to GitHub with all secrets removed and replaced with placeholder values. Users will need to replace these placeholders with their own API keys when using the workflows.

The push completed successfully with the message:

```
To github.com:CTO-development/n8n-free-automation-templates-5000.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.
